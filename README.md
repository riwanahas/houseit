# HouseIt Real Estate App 

HouseIt is a real estate marketplace application to help users browse, list, and predict property prices using AI. The goal was to simplify real estate decisions by offering a platform for exploring listings and receiving instant price estimates based on property details. The project combined mobile development, machine learning, and backend API integration. I built the Android frontend using Kotlin, creating features like account creation, dynamic property listings, filtering, and a personalized saved page. On the backend, we used Python and FastAPI.
